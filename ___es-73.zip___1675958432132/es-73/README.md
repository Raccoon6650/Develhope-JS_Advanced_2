# Exercise Async Callback

Write a function called printAsyncName, which takes a callback and a string(which will be name) as parameters. The callback function will simply print "Hello". The printAsyncName function will have to execute the callback function after an interval of 1 second. After an interval of 2 seconds, we must print the name that we take as a parameter.

Tips:

- The `setInterval` method will be useful
