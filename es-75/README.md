# Exercise Async Callback

Starting from the previous exercise, we want to add to our function `repeatHello`, a `clearInterval` after 5 seconds, could you do that?

Tips:

- The `setInterval` and `setTimeout` methods will be useful
- The callback function must be an arrow function, can you also explain why?
